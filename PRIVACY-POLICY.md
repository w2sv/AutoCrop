# AutoCrop Privacy Policy

AutoCrop is an open source Android app developed by yours truly, Janek Zangenberg. The code is available on GitHub - the very webpage you are currently at - under the GPL-3.0 license.

I hereby solemnly promise, that the app does not collect, let alone share, data of whichever kind. Images, the usage by the app of which you previously have to allow for it to happen, are processed locally and only locally on your device.
Other configurations made by you are likewise stored locally on your device, and will thus remain entirely private. 

Should you inspite of these, the way I see it, rather unambiguous circumstances feel the necessity to contact me regarding any data privacy concern, please feel free to do so at any time. 

Sincerely,\
