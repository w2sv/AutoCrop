- modification of crop save destination directory via main activity popup menu item
- crop display in grid view, possibly with switch possibility to slider view
- possibly manual readjusting possibility of crop
- vertical cropping, possibly to be de-/activated via menu item
- display how much of original image got discarded
- PixelField: 
    - either:
        - accommodate resolution to device performance
        - render colored trace following trajectory of touch input on screen
        - render color configurable 
    - or:
        - implement some animation via OpenGL ES

- if (slider view will be kept) slider view image deletion
- persevering in image gallery after image selection already terminated
- general functioning on several APIs


## Code
- refine


## Performance Assertion
- write system tests for various APIs
- set up CI pipeline


## Development
- maybe write emulator set-up automation script
