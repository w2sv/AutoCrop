Crop as many screenshots residing on your phone as you wish in a single go, examine the results in an image slider, decide which crops ought to be directly saved and - if you wish - have their respective screenshot deleted, or might still need a bit of manual adjustment beforehand, which you can conveniently provide inside the app.

In addition, you can switch on the revolutionary <i>Screenshot Listening</i> function, through which you'll receive a notification when you take a croppable screenshot, whose crafted crop you can then save as you go without even having to open the app.

<b>Additional features:</b>
* Selection of the crop save directory in your file system
* Convenient comparison of the crop and its respective screenshot
* Sharing of crops post-saving 
* Extra juicy animations and overall UI experience
