Crop as many screenshots as you wish in a single go, examine the results in a convenient image slider & determine which crops ought to be directly saved and - if you wish - have their respective screenshot deleted. In the case of them still needing a bit of manual adjustment, you can provide that directly within the app.

Additionally, you can enable the revolutionary <i>Screenshot Listening</i> service, through which you'll immediately receive a notification when you take a croppable screenshot. Thereby, you can save the crop on the go, without even having to open the app.

<b>Additional features:</b>
* Selection of the crop save directory in your file system
* Convenient comparison of the crop and its respective screenshot
* Sharing of crops post-saving 
* Extra juicy animations and overall UI experience

Bug reports, feature requests, general enhancement propositions or other sorts of feedback are always appreciated.
